(12.7) This is what the ignore file looks like:

// add this file to .gitignore

/*
.gitignore example: app/config/keys.js, where .gitignore is inside “root”
  We simply just put in the address relative to where .gitignore is located
*/

// Use this file to store information you want to keep private - such as google clientID/secret

// export an object
module.exports = {
  google: {
    clientID: "client_id_from_google.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    clientSecret:"client_secret_from_google"
  }
}
