  /* 
    Cookies:
      Cookies & Authentication
        ** Cookies tell the website that you are logged in, that you are authenticated **
          Specifically: "A token allows for authentication, this token is stored in a cookie, and is sent back with each subsequent request" 
          Now that the browser has this cookie, every time the browser makes a request to your website (server) in the future, 
            it will SEND the cookie back to the server, with the token as well!
          "The server receives every request that requires authentication and uses the token to authenticate the user (!) and return the requested data back to the client application."
        For example, on the completion of an authentication process you will set an encrypted cookie containing details of the user to be presented with each subsequent request. 

      As long as we go through all of the proper done() methods (regardless if the user information is correct or not, and errors are 'null'),
        the user will be authenticated, telling the whole application that - isAuthenticated() = 'true'
      Serialization sends out user info to "stuff" into a cookie
      Deserialization provides us with that same ID from inside the cookie, which is the ID of the authenticated user (database "row" information)
        When completed, we have a cookie stored in our browser with an authentication token and user id
          If we didnâ€™t have correct user id info, we will STILL have a cookie with an authentication token
        Inside deserialize, we found the matching 'id' value in our database, and we put the CONCISE "database row information" as the 2nd param in the done() method
          From there, we can get this "database row information" off of req.user for this "concise" DB row information AND we enter the OBJECT portion (redirect/flash messages) of the strategy in "routes"
            req.user = 2nd param of deserializeUser done() method
            EXPERIMENT: if 2nd param of deserializeUser done() = 24, then req.user in all "routes" = 24

      Extra notes:
        On any website that we are "logged in", if we delete the cookie, we log out - we aren't authenticated 
          Deleted cookie = deleted access token
        Sessions are usually implemented using cookies
        For our app - we know that we are authenticated when we redirect to /dashboard!
      When it comes to sending data from a server:
        "Data cannot be trusted just like any client input can't, 
          so in practice people often just send a session ID and store the actual data that you might not want people to tamper with on the server side."
    tl;dr: all cookies have a token for authentication, regardless if there is any 'user_id' "stuffed" in the cookie
