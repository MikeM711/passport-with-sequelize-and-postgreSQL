/*  README:
    12.11 We will be moving away from using 'local' authentication, we will be using Google Authentication instead
        To do Google Authentication, this file will not be important to our application anymore
        I am keeping this file to look back on, when it comes to building future models for 'local' authentication

  Notable changes: 
    1. Changed sequelize.define() name from 'user' to 'user-local'
      So read the below notes as if sequelize.define() is 'user'
      Database will create a 'user-locals' table, which will SERVE NO PURPOSE
    2. We don't need a relational foreign key that relates the "todos" table, with this table - so we will remove it by commenting out that "Association" outside of sequelize.define()
      This just makes things look clean on our database, rather than having some strange 'todos_userLocalId_fkey' that serves no purpose

/* 
QUESTIONS:
    1. Can we substitute all 'notEmpty' for 'allowNull' validations?
        ANS: 'null' and 'notEmpty' are two very different things
            '[null]' happens when a value is NOT sent to the database
            'empty' happens when a value is sent to the database, but nothing inside it
            Always use: 'allowNull: false' on all database fields where values are created on INITIAL 'POST' request
    2. last_login timestamp equal to createdAt/updatedAt data types?
        ANS: We didn't really do anything with 'last_login' - but probably it seems
    3. Can we write validations with/witout the 'validations' object?
        ANS: NO - WE MUST USE THE VALIDATIONS OBJECT FOR ALL 'validations'
            Good news: if we make changes to validate: {...} we don't need to delete/recreate our database table!

  The name of the const variable will be the name of our model (capitalized & singular)
      Set our model = sequelize.define() to define mappings between model and table
          First param = SINGULAR name of the database table, as a string
              That singular name will become plural when inserted into postgres
              *This define() string is also the name of this model inside "models" index.js* 
                  So, when we require the "models" index.js as 'modelsRequire', we can say modelsRequire.ModelDefineStringName to have access to a particular model/table! (index.js creates this connection for us)
                  Now that we have access to a specific model, we can use Sequelize Model methods of editing and searching stuff in the database!
              If we were to change the string name, we will AUTOMATICALLY add a table to the database
          Second param = the sequelize model that represents the database table, as an object
              AKA: attributes/fields object
  If we say: sequelize.define('myTableofData', ...)
      And we saved - postgres will automatically create a table called: myTableofDatas

              ANSWER: The passport strategy doesn't let us continue without an 'email' - no empty strings

                      1. The form submit forces execution to enter /signupPOST
                      2. Execution will enter the passport.authenticate's 'local-signin' callback
                      3. Execution will say, "Wait, the default we set {usernameField: 'email'} is empty! (remember?)"
                      4. 'local-signin' immediately fails, and enters 'failureRedirect'

              Why? A FK with CASCADE delete means that if the a record in the parent table is deleted,
                  the corresponding records in the child table will automatically be deleted!
                  This is called "cascade delete" in an SQL server.
              Example: If a user of "id" of 5 gets deleted off of the "users" table, ALL "todo" rows with a field 'userId' value of 5, will automatically get deleted inside "todos" table!
                  This is very good! Thanks to the FK relationship between "users" 'id' and "todos" 'userId'
