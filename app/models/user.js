/* 
QUESTIONS:
    1. Can we substitute all 'notEmpty' for 'allowNull' validations?
        ANS: 'null' and 'notEmpty' are two very different things
            '[null]' happens when a value is NOT sent to the database
            'empty' happens when a value is sent to the database, but nothing inside it
            Always use: 'allowNull: false' on all database fields where values are created on INITIAL 'POST' request
    2. last_login timestamp equal to createdAt/updatedAt data types?
        ANS: We didn't really do anything with 'last_login' - but probably it seems
    3. Can we write validations with/witout the 'validations' object?
        ANS: NO - WE MUST USE THE VALIDATIONS OBJECT FOR ALL 'validations'
            Good news: if we make changes to validate: {...} we don't need to delete/recreate our database table!

    The name of the const variable will be the name of our model (capitalized & singular)
        Set our model = sequelize.define() to define mappings between model and table
            First param = SINGULAR name of the database table, as a string
                That singular name will become plural when inserted into postgres
                *This define() string is also the name of this model inside "models" index.js* 
                    So, when we require the "models" index.js as 'modelsRequire', we can say modelsRequire.ModelDefineStringName to have access to a particular model/table! (index.js creates this connection for us)
                    Now that we have access to a specific model, we can use Sequelize Model methods of editing and searching stuff in the database!
                If we were to change the string name, we will AUTOMATICALLY add a table to the database
            Second param = the sequelize model that represents the database table, as an object
                AKA: attributes/fields object
    If we say: sequelize.define('myTableofData', ...)

                HOW TO DO IT: We need to fully delete our table in the database, if we want to switch "Not NULL?" from 'no' to 'yes'
                    1. Write 'allowNull: false'
                    2. Delete/drop the table in postgres pgadmin

                        If using nodemon - just "save" anywhere to restart
                    4. Disconnect database

                    We may be able to use simple text as "emails", but what if we enter a BLANK email?

                ANSWER: The passport strategy doesn't let us continue without an 'email' - no empty strings
                    Remember: For passport, we swiched the defaults from 'username' -> 'email' field before the Verify Callback function
                    That being said, if "email" is blank, under the conditions of #1 and the form is submitted: 
                        1. The form submit forces execution to enter /signupPOST
                        2. Execution will enter the passport.authenticate's 'local-signin' callback
                        3. Execution will say, "Wait, the default we set {usernameField: 'email'} is empty! (remember?)"
                        4. 'local-signin' immediately fails, and enters 'failureRedirect'
