# passport-with-sequelize-and-postgreSQL
An extremely simple, passport with sequelize and postgreSQL, application

I am using this article - [Tutsplus - Using Passport With Sequelize and MySQL](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/using-passport-with-sequelize-and-mysql--cms-27537) - to create our passport/sequelize/SQL application

I have expanded upon this tutorial, with:
- The ability to use flash messages
- Correct database field validations
- More HTML validations
- More constraints and restrictions of database fields for better security + a Foreign Key relationship between tables
- A Full CRUD application that features a todo list
  - Todo list displays only the todos that a particular user has created
